in scarimba if you are developing ,the dependencies should be downloaded are:
raect-dom@17.0.2
react@17.0.2


moving from react 17 to 18
the changes are:
import reactdom from react-dom/client

render to createRoot:
// ReactDOM.render(navbar, document.getElementById("root"))
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(navbar)

or

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
root.render(navbar)



quick recap:
1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
React is what defines JSX

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
A JavaScript object. React elements that describe what React should
eventually add to the real DOM for us.

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
Declarative means I can tell the computer WHAT to do 
and expect it to handle the details. Imperative means I need
to tell it HOW to do each step.

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
larger/greater than the individual pieces.
